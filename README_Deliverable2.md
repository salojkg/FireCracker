# Deliverable 2 - Diabetic Risk Predictor

We are designing a Diabetes Predictor App using Machine Learning with Dataset from Kaggle.

## Objective

We are using a dataset originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. With this dataset we are testing and developing a Diabetes predictor application. This dataset is used to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain health indicators included in the dataset. In thiis dataset, all patients are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

### Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Matplotlib
- R Studio
- Flask
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript

## Dataset

- Data Source - [Kaggle Database](https://www.kaggle.com/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)
- Filetype - CSV
- File Storage - CSV
- Key Statistics - 768 Rows and 9 Columns

## Dataset Indicators

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

## Data Cleaning

- Used Python for Data cleaning. In this process we understand that BMI, Glucose, Blood Pressure and BMI columuns have values 0. Values with 0 were replaced by Mean or Median depending on the Measures of Central Tendencies
